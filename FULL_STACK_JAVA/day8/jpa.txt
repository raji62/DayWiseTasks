in jdbc:
statement.excuteQuery("selcet * from user where username=?")

in JPA:
TypedQuery<UserQuery("select u from USer u where username=:username",User.class);
List<User>users=q.setParameter("username","vishnu").getResultList()
performance decent
database Independent


Drawbacks:
JPQL->Entities..
I wnated to fetch the data by joining tables:
3 tables->2 tables are entity..1table which is not represented by Entity.
JPQL->does not support join on non-entity tables.
